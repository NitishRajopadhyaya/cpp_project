    2. Multiple Inheritance
    3. Hierarchical Inheritance
    4. Multi-level Inheritance
    5. hybrid Inheritance
    6. Multipath Inheritance

* Ambiguity :- In OOP ambiguity means Duplication of membersdue to inheritance . In base class there will be 2 or more member with same name from inherited class.

* Virtual base class :- To avoid ambiguity we can make the common base class as virtual base class.

* Container class :- Class consists of object of one class in another object.
